### Prerequisites  
Before starting the session you should have:  
- an IBM Cloud account with a promo code added  
- access to github repo https://github.com/binnes/index2018  
- An up to date browser installed on your laptop or workstation  

Optionally you can use any IoT device you may have, if you don't have a physical device then you will see how to use your smart phone or a device simulator during the session.  

## Deploying the Watson IoT Boilerplate
1. Login to the IBM Cloud at https://bluemix.net   
2. Ensure you are working in one of the following regions : Germany, United Kingdom or US South, if not switch to one of the regions (you may need to create a new space in one of the regions if you don't already have one)  
3. Select catalog from the top menu, then Boilerplates from the Platform section of the side menu, then select the Internet of Things Platform Starter  
4. Enter an App name, which must be unique.  Using your initials then the app name can make it easier to create a unique app name.  Leave all the rest of the fields at the default values then hit the create button.  Wait until the application is running (which can take a few minutes)
